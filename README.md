## Hello!

I'm **Mireille Joy R. Dayandayan**, but you can call me **MJ**
  I'm currently a _4th year student_ in **Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology**, pursuing _B.S. Computer Applications_, and an _Internet-of-Things Systems_ major. I have an undeniable love for hardware-related projects, especially when it's combined with software.
